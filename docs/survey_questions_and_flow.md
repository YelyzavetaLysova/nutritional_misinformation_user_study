This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Nutritional Misinformation Survey application, including all questions and the survey flow.

## Survey Flow Overview

The survey follows a specific flow with 7 steps:

1. **Introduction & Consent** - Provides study information and obtains participant consent
2. **Demographics Collection** - Collects basic demographic information
3. **Recipe Evaluation 1** - First recipe evaluation
4. **Recipe Evaluation 2** - Second recipe evaluation
5. **Recipe Evaluation 3** - Third recipe evaluation
6. **Recipe Evaluation 4** - Fourth recipe evaluation
7. **Recipe Evaluation 5** - Fifth recipe evaluation
8. **Post-Survey Questions** - Collects information about cooking habits and AI usage
9. **Debriefing** - Thanks participants and explains the study purpose

The application is designed to be mobile-friendly, with a progress bar showing advancement through the survey.

## Data Storage

The survey data is stored in an SQLite database with the following structure:

1. **participants table** - Stores demographic information
2. **recipe_evaluations table** - Stores recipe ratings and comments
3. **post_surveys table** - Stores post-survey responses

The application also maintains backward compatibility by generating CSV files.

## Technical Implementation

- Built with FastAPI and Jinja2 templates
- Mobile-first responsive design with CSS
- Session management for survey flow control
- Prevents step skipping or backward navigation
- Saves participant responses incrementally
- Uses SQLite for data storage
