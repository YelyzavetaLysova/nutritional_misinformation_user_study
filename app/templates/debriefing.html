                    <h3>About This Study</h3>
                    <p>This research aimed to investigate how people evaluate recipes generated by AI in terms of healthiness, correctness, and complexity. We are particularly interested in how people detect misinformation in AI-generated recipes and whether traditional nutritional knowledge helps in identifying errors.</p>
                    <p>The recipes you evaluated were generated by different AI systems, with some containing deliberate nutritional inaccuracies. Your feedback helps us understand how to improve AI recipe generation and protect users from potential misinformation.</p>
